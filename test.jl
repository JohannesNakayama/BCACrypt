# BLOCK CELLULAR AUTOMATA COMPONENTS (WIKIPEDIA)
#
# * a regular lattice of cells
# * a finite set of the states that each cell may be in
# * a partition of the cells into a uniform tessellation in which each tile of the partition has the same size an shape (NOTE: for example Margolus neighborhood)
# * a rule for shifting the partition after each time step
# * a transition rule, a function that takes as input an assignment of states for the cells in a single tile and produces as output another assignment of states for the same cells
