# NOTES

## TODO

* [x] implement Tron rule
* [x] encode / decode
* [ ] performance improvement

## BLOCK CELLULAR AUTOMATA COMPONENTS (WIKIPEDIA)

* a regular lattice of cells
* a finite set of the states that each cell may be in
* a partition of the cells into a uniform tessellation in which each tile of the partition has the same size an shape (NOTE: for example Margolus neighborhood)
* a rule for shifting the partition after each time step
* a transition rule, a function that takes as input an assignment of states for the cells in a single tile and produces as output another assignment of states for the same cells
